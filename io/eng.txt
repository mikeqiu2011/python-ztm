Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows’s top aide Cassidy Hutchinsonis reportedly expected to testify before the committee investigating the 6 January attacks at the Capitol.

Ms Hutchinson has already provided information to the committee behind closed doors, sitting with the investigators over the span of three separate interviews. She would be the first White House employee to testify publicly before the committee.

The committee had announced a surprise extra hearing that will contain new evidence of Donald Trump’s “dereliction of duty”.

“The final hearing will cover what the president was doing and more importantly, what he was not doing as we were being attacked,” Mr Schiff told NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday.

The latest round of the highly watched inquiry will take place at 1pm ET on Tuesday, 28 June.

Previously, the special congressional committee had no more planned hearings until lawmakers returned from their 4 July recess.

The final hearing will bring to a close a month that featured five other days packed with shocking testimony before the committee.
