Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadowsâ€™s top aide Cassidy Hutchinsonis reportedly expected to testify before the committee investigating the 6 January attacks at the Capitol.

Ms Hutchinson has already provided information to the committee behind closed doors, sitting with the investigators over the span of three separate interviews. She would be the first White House employee to testify publicly before the committee.
